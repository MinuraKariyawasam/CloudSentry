# CloudSentry: A Novel Amalgamate Framework for Monitoring Multi-Tenant Cloud-Based Applications Deployments

## Introduction

This project focuses on the research contribution of the author in developing a cloud-native monitoring solution that can efficiently monitor cloud-based applications. The project aims to propose an amalgamated multi-tenant cloud-based monitoring solution that can reduce redundant logs and help identify threats to cloud-based applications. The author's hypothesis is to propose a cloud-native based architecture that can monitor cloud-based applications more efficiently.

## Theoretical Contribution

The research contribution of the author lies in proposing an amalgamated multi-tenant cloud-based monitoring solution that hasn't been attempted in the previous research. The previous researches have focused on building monitoring solutions on a specific layer that made the monitoring solution complex in daily operations. The proposed architecture reduces redundant logs and helps identify threats to cloud-based applications more efficiently.

## Domain Contribution

Cloud is a fast-growing domain that builds and operates thousands of applications daily. Monitoring is one of the main factors that ensure the uptime of the cloud deployment. Identifying threats quickly is a major advance for cloud and devops teams. In this research project, the author contributes to the domain by proposing a cloud-native monitoring system that can reduce the delay of identifying ingenuous threats to the system and neutralize them.

## Resource Requirements

The project requires the following resources to achieve its goals:

### Software Resources

* Operating System (Linux/Windows) - Linux commonly used for servers and the for cloud deployments. Hence the most of the development will happen on the Linux environment. Windows will be used for the research enhancement and for the documentation processes.
* Terraform - IaC used for formulating the infrastructure on the cloud vendors.
* Python - Run the code in the server and manage all the sub-component and libraries that need to install.
* Kubernetes - Kubernetes is for run the dockerized application and deploy the test application.
* Docker - Dockerize the created application for enhancing the re-usability and simplifying the setup process.
* WSO2 Identity Server - As the framework testing application WSO2 Identity server will be applied.
* React - For GUI creation and for enhancing the application frontend, react will be used.
* VSCode - Development environment for the project and for the implementation part.
* Zotero - As the reference management software.
* MS Office/ Google Docs/ Canva - As the complement to the report, thesis, and the related figures.
* Google Drive/ GitHub - Backup all the codebase and documentation.

### Hardware Resources
* Core i5x Processor (8th generation) or above - To orchestrate the Kubernetes environment and related implementation.
* 8GB RAM or above - To manage the development environment.
* Disk space of 20GB or above - To manage the source code and documentation.

### Skill Requirements
* Creating the required amalgamate monitoring solution cloud deployment monitoring.
* Ability to create a cloud architecture that supports for cloud-native approach.
* Research writing, documentation, and design skills.
